# Dependency Injection (DI)

DI allows us to easily test our code by providing a different dependency to the functions or methods we create.

There are some concerns where we don't want to be writing to a database everytime we test our code.
It also allows for more reusability - e.g. we could write to a file or we could write to stdout.
